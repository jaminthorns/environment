## Initial Setup

Run the `init.sh` script:

  ```shell
  ./init.sh
  ```

## Syncing Configuration

Configuration syncing is specified by the `config/sync.sh` script. Within it,
you can use the bi-directional operations `copy` and `run`:

- `copy` allows you to specify a config folder and a destination folder. On
  `push`, files will be copied from the config folder to the destination folder.
  On `pull`, files will be copied from the destination folder to the config
  folder.
- `run` allows you to specify a script to run on `push` and a script to run on
  `pull`. The scripts will be run from their containing directory.

If configuration is changed inside the repository, run the `push.sh` script:

```shell
./push.sh
```

This will copy files from `config` into the system and run scripts according to
`config/sync.sh`. When copying files, any section that looks like `{{this}}`
will be substituted with the output of the shell command between the braces.

If configuration is changed outside the repository, run the `pull.sh` script:

```shell
./pull.sh
```

This will copy files into `config` from the system and run scripts according to
`config/sync.sh`. If a file with substitutions is changed, its substituted
values will be pulled in, so make sure to ignore those changes.

## Updating Programs

Programs (installed with `apt`, `brew`, `asdf`, and `fisher`) can be updated
with the `update.sh` script:

```shell
./update.sh
```
