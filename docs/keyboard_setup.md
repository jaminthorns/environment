## Steps

- Keys

  - Change knob press to play/pause (`KC_MPLY`)

  - Change `Print Screen` and `Scroll Lock` back to original values

    These keys are by default programmed as non-standard ðŸŽ¤ and ðŸ’¡ keys, but I
    use these for personal shortcuts.

- Lighting

  - Change the backlight effect to `REACTIVE_MULTIWIDE`

  - Change the backlight color to `#CEFF22`

    This looks more yellow than green, but it renders as an earthy light green
    on the Keychron Q3.
